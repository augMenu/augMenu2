*View your food in augmented reality before you order*

Have you ever gone out to eat and wondered what it was you were ordering? Are you eating at a restaurant where you don't know the language? Da heck is pesto?! Augmenu is mobile app that you can use to solve this problem!

Using React Native, Viro React, AWS and Google Cloud Vision's text recognition API, we created an app that has the ability to recognize menu items in various languages and redner that food in augmented reality for users. 

In order to test our app, you'll need to do a few things to set up:

1. Fork and clone our repository onto your computer
2. Run `npm i` 
3. Download the Viro Media app for android or iOS
4. Run `npm start` in the apps main directory
5. In the Viro Media app, navigate to the enter testbed section and enter the URL generated from starting the app locally
6. Let the application bundle on your phone and then hopefully you should be up and running!
